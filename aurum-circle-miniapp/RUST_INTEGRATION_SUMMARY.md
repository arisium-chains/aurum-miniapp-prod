# Rust ML Services Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate the Rust-based ML services with the Aurum Circle Miniapp.

## Overview

The integration adds high-performance Rust-based ML services for face detection and face embedding extraction to replace the simulated ML components in the existing system. The integration maintains backward compatibility by providing a fallback mechanism to the simulated ML when the Rust services are unavailable.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### ML Face Score API Service (`miniapp/aurum-circle-miniapp/ml-face-score-api/`)

- **`src/services/rust-ml-client.ts`** - Client for communicating with Rust ML services
- **`src/services/hybrid-scorer.ts`** - Hybrid scorer that uses Rust services with fallback to simulated ML
- **`.env.example`** - Example environment variables file
- **`.env`** - Environment variables configuration
- **`README.md`** - Documentation for the ML Face Score API with Rust integration
- **`src/test-queue.ts`** - Test script for adding jobs to the queue

### 2. Modified Files

#### ML Face Score API Service (`miniapp/aurum-circle-miniapp/ml-face-score-api/`)

- **`src/workers/faceScoring.worker.ts`** - Updated to use the hybrid scorer
- **`src/services/scorer.ts`** - Updated to include a new function for processing base64 images with the hybrid scorer
- **`package.json`** - Added `axios` dependency for HTTP requests to Rust services

#### Main Miniapp (`miniapp/aurum-circle-miniapp/`)

- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Updated to include Rust ML services
- **`README.md`** - Updated to document the Rust ML integration

## Integration Details

### Architecture

The integration follows the architecture specified in the `RUST_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`:

```
Next.js App → Redis Queue → Node.js ML Workers → Rust ML Services → Qdrant DB
                                   ↓
                           Health Monitoring
```

### Components

1. **Rust ML Client** - Handles communication with the Rust services
2. **Hybrid Scorer** - Uses real ML with fallback to simulated ML
3. **Worker Update** - Modified to use the hybrid scorer
4. **Docker Compose** - Updated to include Rust services

### Fallback Mechanism

The system includes a robust fallback mechanism:

1. Check health of Rust services before processing
2. If Rust services are healthy, use them for processing
3. If Rust services are unavailable or fail, fall back to simulated ML
4. Continue to function even when Rust services are down

### Environment Configuration

New environment variables have been added:

- `FACE_DETECTION_SERVICE` - URL for the face detection Rust service
- `FACE_EMBEDDING_SERVICE` - URL for the face embedding Rust service
- `ML_SERVICE_TIMEOUT` - Timeout for requests to Rust services
- `USE_REAL_ML` - Flag to enable/disable real ML processing
- `FALLBACK_TO_SIMULATED` - Flag to enable/disable fallback to simulated ML
- `SIMULATED_ML_THRESHOLD` - Threshold for using simulated ML

## Testing

The integration includes a test script (`src/test-queue.ts`) for verifying the functionality.

## Deployment

The `docker-compose.yml` file has been updated to include the Rust services:

- `face-detection-service` - Face detection Rust service
- `face-embedding-service` - Face embedding Rust service

These services are built from the Rust code in the `aurum-ml-services` directory.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the Rust services to production environment
2. Test the integration with real ML models
3. Monitor performance and error rates
4. Optimize based on production data
