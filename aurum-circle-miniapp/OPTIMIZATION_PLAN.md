# Optimization Plan for Aurum Circle Miniapp

## Current Size Analysis
- Repository size (after optimization): ~833MB
- Git history: ~830MB (mostly in .git directory)
- Source code and assets: ~3MB
- package-lock.json: ~468KB

## Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. Model Files Removal
- Removed ML model files from Git tracking to reduce repository size
- Created a script to download models separately during deployment
- Updated documentation to explain the new model setup process

### 2. Git History Cleanup
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove model files from Git history
- Cleaned up Git references and ran garbage collection
- Reduced repository size from over 2GB to ~833MB

### 3. Build Process Optimization
- Enabled Next.js built-in optimizations:
  - `compress: true` in next.config.mjs
  - Webpack minimization in production builds

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Done
1. Removed model files from Git tracking using .gitignore
2. Removed model files from Git history using git filter-branch
3. Cleaned up Git repository with reflog expiration and garbage collection
4. Created model download script for deployment
5. Updated documentation to explain new setup process
6. Enabled Next.js compression and webpack optimization

### Results
- Repository size reduced from over 2GB to ~833MB
- Git history cleaned of large model files
- Deployment process now downloads models separately instead of including them in the repo

## Alternative Approaches for Further Optimization

### 1. Move to Git LFS
For teams that need to keep model files in version control:
- Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for model files
- This keeps files in version control while storing large files separately

### 2. CDN Hosting
For production deployments:
- Host models on a CDN
- Download during deployment process
- Use environment variables to configure model paths

### 3. On-demand Loading
For web-based deployments:
- Load models on-demand via HTTP requests
- Implement progressive loading for better user experience
- Use service workers for caching

## Expected Performance Improvement
With these optimizations:
- Push/pull times should be reduced by 60-70%
- Clone times should be significantly faster
- CI/CD pipeline should run more efficiently
- Overall deployment process should be smoother

The current repository size of ~833MB is much more manageable than the original 2GB+, and should resolve the timeout issues you were experiencing.
