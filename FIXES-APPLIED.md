# Production Deployment Fixes Applied

This document summarizes all the issues identified and fixed to make the Aurum Miniapp production-ready.

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing ML API Routes in Nginx Configuration
**Problem**: The nginx configuration had commented-out ML API routes, causing 404 errors for `/ml-api/*` endpoints.

**Fix**: Added proper ML API proxy configuration in `deploy/nginx/conf/default.conf`:
```nginx
location /ml-api/ {
    proxy_pass http://ml-api:3000/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
}
```

### 2. SSL/TLS Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Port 443 was exposed but SSL configuration was incomplete and commented out.

**Fix**: 
- Commented out port 443 binding in docker-compose until SSL is properly configured
- Reorganized nginx configuration with clear HTTP/HTTPS separation
- Added instructions for SSL setup in production

### 3. Monorepo Docker Build Context Issues
**Problem**: Dockerfiles expected different build contexts than what docker-compose was providing.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `apps/web/Dockerfile` to work with standalone build context
- Updated `apps/ml-api/Dockerfile` to work with standalone build context
- Removed references to non-existent shared packages
- Fixed environment file copying issues

### 4. Missing Environment Files
**Problem**: Applications referenced `.env.production.local` and other environment files that didn't exist.

**Fix**: 
- Created `.env.production` with all required environment variables
- Created `apps/ml-api/.env.production` for ML API specific configuration
- Updated docker-compose to use `env_file` directive
- Made environment file copying optional in Dockerfiles

### 5. Conflicting Docker Compose Files
**Problem**: Multiple docker-compose.yml files in different directories caused confusion and conflicts.

**Fix**: 
- Renamed conflicting files to `.backup` extensions
- Created single `docker-compose.prod.yml` in root directory
- Consolidated all service definitions into one file

### 6. Missing Health Checks
**Problem**: No health checks configured for services, making it difficult to determine service readiness.

**Fix**: 
- Added health checks for all services (app, ml-api, nginx, redis, qdrant)
- Installed `wget` in Docker images for health check commands
- Configured proper health check intervals and timeouts

### 7. Missing Production Deployment Scripts
**Problem**: No automated deployment process for production environments.

**Fix**: 
- Created `deploy-production.sh` script with comprehensive deployment automation
- Added `validate-deployment.sh` for pre-deployment validation
- Included error handling, logging, and rollback capabilities

### 8. Inadequate Documentation
**Problem**: No clear production deployment instructions.

**Fix**: 
- Created `PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment guide
- Added troubleshooting section
- Included security considerations and performance optimization tips

### 9. Missing Security Configurations
**Problem**: Default configurations not suitable for production.

**Fix**: 
- Added security headers in nginx configuration
- Created non-root users in Docker containers
- Added proper file permissions
- Included firewall configuration instructions

### 10. Resource Management Issues
**Problem**: No resource limits or monitoring configured.

**Fix**: 
- Added volume management for persistent data
- Configured proper restart policies
- Added logging configuration
- Included resource monitoring instructions

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

- `apps/ml-api/docker-compose.yml` ‚Üí `apps/ml-api/docker-compose.yml.backup`

## üöÄ Deployment Process

The application can now be deployed using:

```bash
# Validate configuration
./validate-deployment.sh

# Deploy to production
./deploy-production.sh

# Check status
./deploy-production.sh status

# View logs
./deploy-production.sh logs

# Stop services
./deploy-production.sh stop
```

## üîç Service Architecture

The production deployment includes:

1. **Nginx** (Port 80) - Reverse proxy and load balancer
2. **Web App** (Port 3000) - Next.js frontend application
3. **ML API** (Port 3001) - Machine learning face scoring service
4. **Redis** (Port 6379) - Caching and session storage
5. **Qdrant** (Port 6333) - Vector database for ML operations
