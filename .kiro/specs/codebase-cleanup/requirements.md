# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up the current codebase by removing unused code, eliminating unrelated documentation, restructuring the directory layout for better organization, and ensuring the docker-compose configuration works seamlessly across the entire workspace. The goal is to create a clean, maintainable, and well-structured monorepo that supports efficient development and deployment workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused code and files from the codebase, so that the repository is clean and maintainable without unnecessary bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all unused TypeScript/JavaScript files, functions, and imports
2. WHEN analyzing documentation THEN the system SHALL identify outdated, duplicate, or unrelated documentation files
3. WHEN removing unused code THEN the system SHALL preserve all actively used components and their dependencies
4. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL maintain git history and provide a summary of removed items
5. IF a file is potentially unused THEN the system SHALL verify it's not referenced in docker-compose, package.json, or configuration files before removal

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured directory layout, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring directories THEN the system SHALL follow monorepo best practices with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN organizing apps THEN the system SHALL ensure each app has consistent internal structure (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
3. WHEN organizing shared resources THEN the system SHALL create dedicated directories for shared libraries, configurations, and infrastructure
4. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL update all import paths and references automatically
5. IF duplicate functionality exists across apps THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into shared libraries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified docker-compose configuration, so that I can run the entire workspace with a single command and have all services properly integrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring docker-compose THEN the system SHALL create a root-level configuration that orchestrates all services
2. WHEN defining services THEN the system SHALL ensure proper networking, volume mounting, and environment variable management
3. WHEN starting services THEN the system SHALL ensure proper startup order and health checks
4. WHEN accessing services THEN the system SHALL configure proper port mapping and service discovery
5. IF services have dependencies THEN the system SHALL configure proper depends_on relationships and wait conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent development tooling across all apps, so that I can use the same commands and workflows regardless of which app I'm working on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development tools THEN the system SHALL provide consistent package.json scripts across all apps
2. WHEN configuring linting THEN the system SHALL use shared ESLint and TypeScript configurations
3. WHEN setting up testing THEN the system SHALL provide consistent test runners and coverage reporting
4. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL use consistent build processes and output structures
5. IF an app needs specific tooling THEN the system SHALL extend the base configuration rather than replacing it

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and setup instructions, so that new team members can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive root-level README with project overview
2. WHEN documenting apps THEN the system SHALL ensure each app has specific setup and usage instructions
3. WHEN documenting architecture THEN the system SHALL create clear diagrams showing service relationships and data flow
4. WHEN providing setup instructions THEN the system SHALL include both development and production deployment guides
5. IF configuration is required THEN the system SHALL provide example files and clear instructions for customization
